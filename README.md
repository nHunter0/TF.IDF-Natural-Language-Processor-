# TF-IDF Calculator

## Introduction

This is a TF-IDF calculator, a simple and efficient tool to compute the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) of a text corpus. The tool supports both .txt and .pdf files. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter and drag-and-drop functionality using TkinterDnD2.

The TF-IDF Calculator was developed with the help of ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI.

## How to Use

1. Start the program, a window will appear with a list box and a text box.
2. Use the "Open File" button to select .txt or .pdf files. Multiple files can be selected at once.
3. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the files into the list box.
4. Select a file from the list box to display its content in the text box.
5. Click the "Calculate TF-IDF" button to calculate and display the TF-IDF scores of the selected file in the text box.
6. The "Download CSV" button will save the TF-IDF scores in a CSV file.

Please note that the TF-IDF scores are calculated based on the entire corpus (all the documents you've selected or dropped into the list box).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt in the folder where you downloaded the code.
3. Ensure Python is installed by running `python --version`. If Python is installed correctly, it will display the version.
4. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
